- **The 2-bring_me_home script** changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory by using the "cd ~" shell command.
- **The 3-listfiles script** displays the contents of the current directory of the user in a long format. It uses the "ls -l" command to achieve that. 
- **The 4-listmorefiles script** shows the contents of the current working directory contents of the user, including their hidden files (starting with .) in a long format by using the "ls -1 -al" script command.
- **The 5-listfilesdigitonly script** prints the display current directory contents. It does so by printing its long format alongside their user and group IDs, numerically,
and hidden files (starting with .).

- **The 14-copy_html script** creates a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.
