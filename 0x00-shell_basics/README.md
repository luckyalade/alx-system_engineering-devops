# Short description of the functions of the following script:

1. **"The ./0-current_working_directory script"** prints the absolute path name of the current working directory using the "pwd" shell command.
2. **The 1-listit script** lists the contents of the current working directory of the user. It does this with the "ls" script command.
3. **The 2-bring_me_home script** changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory by using the "cd ~" shell command.
4. **The 3-listfiles script** displays the contents of the current directory of the user in a long format. It uses the "ls -l" command to achieve that. 
5. **The 4-listmorefiles script** shows the contents of the current working directory contents of the user, including their hidden files (starting with .) in a long format by using the "ls -1 -al" script command.
